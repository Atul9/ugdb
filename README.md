ugdb
====

ugdb is an [unsegen](https://github.com/ftilde/unsegen) based alternative TUI for [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/).

## Building

linkcheck is written in Rust and needs a working installation of cargo to build.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ftilde/ugdb
$ cd ugdb
$ cargo build --release
$ target/release/ugdb
```

## Usage

```
$ linkcheck --help
```

## Some notes on the status
This project mostly scratches my own itch -- successfully. I use it as my primary debugger. I that sense I consider this project as "done", but additional sub-itches may be sub-scratched in the future.
