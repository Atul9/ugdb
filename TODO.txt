Improve Container management:
 - More layouts, center tile (large) with smaller tiles around it
 - Configurable by layout file (yaml), use serde

Add MemoryViewer:
 - It may be useful to use a table, or just use split windows

Smaller QoL-changes:
 - Add a "running" indicator in prompt
 - Detect changes in active (binary) file and reload if needed
 - Do not skip reloading source files in viewer if file has changed

Fix bugs:
 - GDB sometimes takes ages to disassemble code blocks. Work around by disassembling lazily, i.e., only when assembly is shown.
