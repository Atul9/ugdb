Add Container management:
 - Top level layouting as a tree of containers (cf. i3)
 - Different kinds of containers (hsplit, vsplit, widget (or extension), grid?
 - Configurable by layout file (yaml), use serde

Add MemoryViewer:
 - It may be useful to use a table, or just use split windows

Smaller QoL-changes:
 - Add a "running" indicator in prompt

Fix bugs:
 - Insert breakpoint when running results in crash
 - Invalid breakpoint when setting bp in function which is inlined (maybe?). There may be other similar bugs.
 - Detect changes in active file and reload if needed
 - Hitting enter in LineEdit
