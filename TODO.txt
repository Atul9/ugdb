Add ExpressionTable:
 - JsonViewer

Add Container management:
 - Top level layouting as a tree of containers (cf. i3)
 - Different kinds of containers (hsplit, vsplit, widget (or extension), grid?
 - Configurable by layout file (json)

Fully implement PseudoTerminal as a TerminalEmulator
 - Use https://crates.io/crates/vte
 - It should probably be moved to a separate crate

Add IPC framework
 - Should be used to (e.g.) set breakpoints, get current src position
 - https://crates.io/crates/unix_socket
 - Implement corresponding vim plugin

Add MemoryViewer:
 - It may be useful to use a table, or just use split windows

Fix bugs:
 - Insert breakpoint when running results in crash
 - Invalid breakpoint when setting bp in function which is inlined (maybe?). There may be other similar bugs.
 - Show portion of code code when frame changes
 - Support showing code when only assembly is available
 - Detect changes in active file and reload if needed
 - Hitting enter in LineEdit
